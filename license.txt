    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program; 

    Linking RTC-scilab library statically or dynamically with other modules is making a combined work based on RTC-scilab. Thus, the terms and conditions of the GNU General Public License cover the whole combination.

    In addition, as a special exception, the copyright holders of RTC-scilab give you permission to combine OpenRTM-aist library and SimulationEC library with free software programs or libraries that are released under the EPL and with code included in the standard release of RTC-scilab library under the GPL2. You may copy and distribute such a system following the terms of the GNU GPL for RTC-scilab and the licenses of the other code concerned{, provided that you include the source code of that other code when and as the GNU GPL requires distribution of source code}.

    Note that people who make modified versions of RTC-scilab are not obligated to grant this special exception for their modified versions; it is their choice whether to do so. The GNU General Public License gives permission to release a modified version without this exception; this exception also makes it possible to release a modified version which carries forward this exception.
